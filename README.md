# ReVanced Pre-release Patches for Manager (Unofficial)

## üëÅÔ∏è Overview

This repository allows the use of development (pre-release) patches in ReVanced Manager. The patches hosted here are sourced directly from the [ReVanced patches repository](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches) and automatically synced.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes on Using Development Patches

Using development (pre-release) patches means you‚Äôre working with versions that are still in testing, so there's a higher chance of issues when applying them through ReVanced Manager. If the patching process fails or the app doesn‚Äôt work as expected, you can:

- Reset the patch source to the default in **Settings** in ReVanced Manager to revert to stable patches.
- Alternatively, you can patch the app manually using the [ReVanced CLI](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-cli) with these development [patches](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/releases).
